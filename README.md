# First RPG Testing Game
---
The aim of the exercise was to come up with a Heroic Fantasy themed game and to use javascript
to make the game fuctional. Although very basic, the multiple choice of attacks, and the randomness of misses makes it more challenging for the player.

*It is to be noted that the game is yet to be completely finished, HP bars are not yet animated and there seems to be a little glitch with the "heal" fuction.*
